# Simple JavaScript TMX loader
This is just a simple loader for tmx files in javascript. Inspired by this repository: https://github.com/evilangelist/tmx-loader.js

## Requirements
jquery 

## How to use
You can simply checkout or download the repository und run the index.html from the examples folder. 
Open your console to see the parsed object.

**Important note:** You need to run index.html from a webserver in order to load the tmx file. Or you can disable cross origin check in your browser but i would't recommend that.
